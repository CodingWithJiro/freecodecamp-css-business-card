## ℹ️ Business Card Design Project

![Screenshot of the project](./screenshot.png)

This project is a clean and minimal business card component created using only HTML and CSS. It mimics the design of a modern business profile card with user information, contact details, and social media links—all wrapped in a visually appealing layout.

It was built entirely with HTML and CSS as part of the [**freeCodeCamp.org**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/) CSS course.

## 🔍 Overview

This project contains a responsive business card layout featuring a profile image, name, job title, company, contact info, and social links. The card uses semantic HTML and clear class naming for structure, along with consistent visual styling via CSS variables and shadows.

It’s styled using modern design principles such as box shadows, border-radius, and variable-based theming. The layout centers the card for desktop and small screen widths using margin and responsive max-width settings.
